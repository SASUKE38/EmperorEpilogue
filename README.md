## About
This mod gives the Emperor an active role in the game's epilogue if his romance arc was completed and the player is in no other relationship. 
This mod works regardless of whether or not the player is illithid. It adds a post final battle scene with him in the Elfsong Tavern like the 
rest of the vanilla romance options have and allows him to attend the epilogue party if the player to chooses to continue their relationship with him.

The Elfsong dialogue provides some unique alternatives for the player:
* Becoming a mind flayer after the battle
* Adopting Us
* Offering the Emperor her brain and memories if she refuses to travel to Avernus or become a mind flayer (Avatar Karlach)

A player partnered with the Emperor now has the following ending paths:
* Creating a renegade mind flayer colony with the survivors of the battle
* Saving illithid survivors of the final battle and giving them a home (Knights of the Shield variation)
* Adventuring with the Emperor
* Traveling to Avernus with the Emperor (Avatar Karlach)
* Living with the Emperor without being involved in his organizations or plans
* Running the Knights of the Shield (vanilla)
* Creating a shadow network across the Sword Coast (vanilla)

At the party, the Emperor and player can do the following:
* Discuss their relationship and life together
* Share a hug and/or kiss
* Discuss the Emperor's thoughts on the companions and their situations
