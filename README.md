## About
$${\color{yellow}\text{You must load a save from before traveling to the Morphic Pool (endgame/finale) for this mod to work.}}$$

This mod gives the Emperor an active role in the game's epilogue if his romance arc was completed and the player is in no other relationship, regardless of whether or not the player is illithid. It adds a post final battle scene with him in the Elfsong Tavern like the 
rest of the vanilla romance options have and allows him to attend the epilogue party if the player to chooses to continue their relationship with him.

The Elfsong dialogue provides some unique alternatives for the player:
* Becoming a mind flayer after the battle
* Adopting Us
* Avatar Karlach: Offering the Emperor her brain and memories if she refuses to travel to Avernus or become a mind flayer

A player partnered with the Emperor now has the following ending paths:
* Creating a renegade mind flayer colony with the survivors of the battle
* Saving illithid survivors of the final battle and giving them a home (Knights of the Shield variation)
* Adventuring with the Emperor
* Living with the Emperor without being involved in his organizations or plans
* Avatar Karlach: Traveling to Avernus with the Emperor
* Vanilla Option: Running the Knights of the Shield
* Vanilla Option: Creating a shadow network across the Sword Coast

At the party, the Emperor and player can do the following:
* Discuss their relationship and life together
* Share a hug and/or kiss
* Discuss the Emperor's thoughts on the companions and their situations

## Installation
The mod can be installed with the in-game mod manager by placing the .pak file in your \AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods folder and then activating it in-game or via the Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager. See the "Compatibility" section below for an important note on load order. 

## Compatibility
This mod should most likely be loaded before any mod that alters the behavior/gameplay of the finale and/or epilogue. In other words, this mod should most likely be loaded before any mods that alter the following scripts:

* Act3c_EPI_Gazettes.txt
* Act3c_EPI_Letters.txt

* Party intro cutscene
* Player mind flayer brain eating urge dialog
* Karlach in Avernus cutscene
* Death of Karlach dialog (Post-battle/Post-Elfsong dock conversation)
* Combat Over, Emperor Solo dialog (Segment of post-battle dock conversation that handles no companions, only Emperor case)
