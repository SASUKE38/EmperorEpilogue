TODO:

Dialogues:
- Finish writing EPI_Epilogue_Emperor dialogue
- Finish writing END_GameFinale_RomanceFates_Emperor
- Figure out why MindFlayerUrge does not seem to play anymore
- Check if GaleWantsDrink flag in the conclusion dialogue can be set for "good" emperor route

Timelines:
- Create EPI_Epilogue_Emperor timeline
- Create END_GameFinale_RomanceFates_Emperor timeline
- Create MindFlayerUrge nested timeline

Scripting:
- Make sure emperor romance fate does not interfere with others and that it triggers properly
- Get the emperor to follow the player (or make new emperor npc if needed)

Miscellaneous:
- Edit appropriate gazette lines, text in TranslatedStringKey and assigned by Act3c_EPI_Gazettes script

Stretch:
- Custom animations for emperor hug and kiss (would need help)
- Custom emperor outfit (would need help)
- add emperor voice barks
